# Indentation

# It refers to spaces at the beginning of code line
# Used to represent a block of code

# Lines with same spaces before them noted as a block of code

    print("Five is greater than two")

    print("Five is smaller than two")

#if we not use indentation it will give an error

# As we use {} in  c++ here we use spaces
#spaces may be 1,2 or a tab
# The space we give to first line then we have to give other lines the same space to represent a block
