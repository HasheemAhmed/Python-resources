Welcome to the **Python 30-Day Learning Journey** repository! This project documents my journey of learning Python in just 30 days, covering a wide range of essential topics, from the basics to more advanced concepts like object-oriented programming, file handling, and database interaction.

## üöÄ Overview

Throughout this journey, I completed several hands-on exercises and mini-projects, each focusing on a specific aspect of Python. This repository contains the scripts and projects that helped me solidify my understanding of the language.

### Key Topics Covered:
1. **Getting Started & Syntax**
   - Basic structure, variables, comments, and data types.
2. **Numbers & Math**
   - Operations with integers, floats, and complex numbers.
3. **Strings**
   - String manipulation, slicing, f-strings, and methods.
4. **Data Structures**
   - Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
5. **Control Flow & Loops**
   - If-else statements, for-loops, while-loops, and more.
6. **Functions & Lambda Expressions**
   - Writing functions, using lambda expressions.
7. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
8. **File Handling**
   - Reading, writing, and manipulating files.
9. **Regular Expressions**
   - Pattern matching using regex.
10. **Database Interaction**
    - Connecting to MySQL, creating tables, running queries.

Here are some of the mini-projects included in this repository:
- **String Statistics**: Analyzing the length and frequency of characters in strings.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**: A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- **School Management System**: A basic system for managing student and teacher data.
- **Excel File Handling**: Reading, writing, and updating Excel files using Python.
- **Database Projects**: Interacting with a MySQL database to create, insert, and select data.
